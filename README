To execute HTTP requests, either open a new terminal and craft the request there, or use Burp Suite
For HTTP Requests, you can use netcat following the format:
echo -e "__msg__" | nc localhost 8000
or you can use curl following the format:
curl -i -X {POST/GET} -d "{data}" -H {header} link 
eg. curl -i -X POST -H "Content-Type:application/json" -H "Content-Length:130" -d '{ "id": 3, "name": "Charlie", "age": 23, "course": "Artificial Intelligence" }' http://localhost:8000/malicious
- this is a valid command, that should show "message": "Malicious action executed." on the page when reloaded or in terminal depending on whether you use burp suite / terminal respectively
